*Regional cycling maps inspired by metro/subway lines*

## Why Metro-Style Bike Maps?

Since getting into road and gravel cycling a couple years ago, I've found that longer rides I planned often reused the same segments of common routes.  I've long wanted to catalog these segments to document what is effectively a regional network of bike routes, but details of that network are often buried in the tribal knowledge of local cycling clubs and communities.

I figured that treating route segments like subway or metro rail lines would make a more effective visual, without the clutter of local roads found on typical cycling maps and route planning tools.

So, what started as a fun experiment and creative outlet is now an attempt to provide a practical tool to cyclists for longer-distance route planning, with familiar public transport/transit map styling providing a local flavor.

## Instructions

Click the file in your desired format (PDF for original quality, or PNG if it's easier to work with an image) to preview or download the map.

While some routes and trails are well-signed and can be navigated by using map waypoints (as a makeshift cue sheet), I highly recommend using the map primarily to get a general idea of where you want to ride, then use other route planning tools to facilitate navigation via your phone or head unit.

> ***NYC only:**  Waypoints marked as "common stops" (indicated by a bolded route code) roughly correspond to locations with services such as water, beverages for purchase, and in some cases restrooms and bike parking.  However, these designations are somewhat arbitrary, so please cross-reference other sources before planning stops at these locations.*

If taking the train for part of your trip, please also reference official transit resources to find the specific service, station, and timetable associated with indicated rail connections.  Check agency websites for any restrictions on bringing your bike on the train.  Icons should be considered illustrative.

In the future, I would like to find the time to pair these maps with route reviews (complete with GPX files), or maybe even a build a tool to generate navigable routes based on a choice of waypoints.  Until then, these maps are best used as a general reference.

## The Story Behind the Maps

I was inspired by create these maps by a comment exchange on [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chibike/comments/snqnli/share_your_long_ride_plans/) about planning bike rides around the Chicago region.  I had been struggling to come up with a way to publish my favorite routes, so I thought that creating a map of the area's trails would a fun short-term project while I figured out how.

The positive reception to my Chicago map -- along with the observation that it highlighted gaps in the region's bike infrastructure -- led me to build another map for the NYC area, where the COVID-19 pandemic unfortunately limited me to just a few months of riding.  However, meeting the wonderful people in [Cycling Fanatics New York](http://cfny.cc/) gave me enough opportunities to learn the lay of the land, even after relocating away (many thanks!).

Due to my limited design skills, my general approach to building these maps was to insert a map underlay (a Google Map for Chicago, and stitched together map vectors for NYC extracted using Inkscape) in the slide master of a custom-sized PowerPoint deck, then use basic drawing tools to replicate the local transit agency styles to the best of my ability.

I later found that transit-style bike maps aren't exactly an original idea -- I've found examples ranging from [Los Angeles](http://www.beverlyhillsbikeshop.com/content/images/labikemap.pdf) to [Washington DC](https://ggwash.org/view/63612/the-subway-style-bike-map-returns-with-a-few-tweaks), along with this one covering [the city of Chicago](https://chi.streetsblog.org/2019/07/02/our-transit-style-map-of-the-chicago-bike-network-highlights-coverage-equity-issues/).  Bloomberg CityLab has [even covered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-02/how-to-get-more-people-to-bike-better-maps) an effort by designer [Michael Graham](http://www.spiderbikemaps.com/) to do this as well.  But I figure that getting more content creators involved in documenting cycling infrastructure can only be a good thing.

## Notes and Feedback

Given these are essentially early drafts, I erred on the side of showing too much detail, thinking I could always declutter the maps later.  Some people have also pointed out that taking styling cues from public transit runs the risk of creating a "false equivalence" -- confusing people on what the lines are meant to represent.

My approaches for Chicago and NYC also diverged somewhat, since the former largely covers the suburban trail network, while the latter includes a lot of road cycling routes.

In the long run, I would love to develop a unified map style dedicated to the specific needs of cyclists, which may differ for commuters, roadies, gravelers, and bikepackers/bike tourists.  However, to the extent that paying homage to transit maps can bring attention to cycling infrastructure -- I'd love to keep this project going at some level, so long as it's useful.

I've included notes hinting at future plans throughout this document, but given this is very much a side project, expect progress and updates on future plans (including the use of the Issues feature here) to be slow and piecemeal.  However, please don't hesitate to leave feedback (based on your own cycling experience) on my original Reddit posts, direct any inquiries through Reddit private messages ([u/cymikelee](https://www.reddit.com/user/cymikelee)), or use my contact information [here on GitHub](https://github.com/cymikelee), until I start up a social media presence.
